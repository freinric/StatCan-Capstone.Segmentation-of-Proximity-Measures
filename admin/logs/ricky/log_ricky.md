The following is a recommended way of keeping track of your weekly hours
using this RMarkdown file. Note that it will do all the calculations for
you, you just need to enter in hours worked and a description of the
task in the correct spot.

## Instructions

1.  For each week, first set the `current.week` to the week number (in
    most cases, you can increment the `current.week` by 1).  

2.  Add row entries to your table indicating the date of the task, the
    number of hours spent on the task, a description of the task, as
    well any comments (or reminders to yourself) or requests for
    follow-up.

3.  Knit the file to a markdown file.

4.  Before Friday at 5 PM, please submit a Pull Request to merge in your
    weekly log. All your team mates will review your log, provide
    comments and suggestions, and then approve (or request changes).
    Once all the changes have been resolved, you can merge in your pull
    request (by Monday at 10 AM).

5.  Don’t forget to review the Pull Requests by your team mates!

6.  Discuss any discrepancies or team dynamics issues with your assigned
    TA during the weekly meetings.

**Remember that your `markdown` file is what will be reviewed by your
teammates, the TAs, and the instructors, so just make sure it renders
correctly!**

### Weekly Reflection

We did a lot of group work this week: creating the team contract and
code of conduct, working on the proposal, and working on the slides for
the monday meeting. We split off into two groups to draft the proposal
report, half of us doing the literature review and proposal
introduction, and the other half drafting the methods, research
questions, and schedule. Through my literature review, I found out about
the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm and added it to the list to try
out. We all came together to put everything together and review and
elevate each other’s work. There are no major roadblocks preventing us
from proceeding in our project.

### Weekly Reflection

My most significant individual contribution to the project this week was
the work I put into the EDA, and looking into what was the distribution
of proximity measures when the population of a DB is 0 vs when it is
not. I found out about and applied the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The most
significant team contribution was talking with Jesse, who sent us
resources about packages that help deal with NA values, to get us on the
right track. The team started to investigate and apply these resources.
This week we had major blockers of memory issues and computational
power. We’ve somewhat solved the memory issues for some of us, but lack
of computational power leads to waiting a long time for something to
run, which doesn’t feel efficient.

My total weekly hours are: 20

### Weekly Reflection

My most significant individual contribution was reminding my team
members that scaling is important and will change results when running
some clustering algorithms, like the k-means. Our most significant group
contribution is the group meeting with the DEIL team that made the PMD
dataset: it gave us a lot of insight into the NA values and
interpretation of proximity values, as well as insight into DB and
different geographical areas. Some roadblocks this week include long
running times, interpretation issues, and incongruence in feedback and
acceptance of it. This week was short on hours because I was traveling
from Thursday on to my Brother’s grad out of province.

### Weekly Reflection

My most significant contribution was implementing agendas for all of our
meetings, including preparing them and moderating meetings. This has
helped a lot for accountability and to use the meeting time
meaningfully. Our most significant group contribution was making and
presenting the midterm presentation. It helped center and reflect on our
project. Roadblocks this week include unexpected results, showing the
need to investigate algorithms and validation techniques some more.
