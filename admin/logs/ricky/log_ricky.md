The following is a recommended way of keeping track of your weekly hours
using this RMarkdown file. Note that it will do all the calculations for
you, you just need to enter in hours worked and a description of the
task in the correct spot.

## Instructions

1.  For each week, first set the `current.week` to the week number (in
    most cases, you can increment the `current.week` by 1).  

2.  Add row entries to your table indicating the date of the task, the
    number of hours spent on the task, a description of the task, as
    well any comments (or reminders to yourself) or requests for
    follow-up.

3.  Knit the file to a markdown file.

4.  Before Friday at 5 PM, please submit a Pull Request to merge in your
    weekly log. All your team mates will review your log, provide
    comments and suggestions, and then approve (or request changes).
    Once all the changes have been resolved, you can merge in your pull
    request (by Monday at 10 AM).

5.  Don’t forget to review the Pull Requests by your team mates!

6.  Discuss any discrepancies or team dynamics issues with your assigned
    TA during the weekly meetings.

**Remember that your `markdown` file is what will be reviewed by your
teammates, the TAs, and the instructors, so just make sure it renders
correctly!**

### Weekly Reflection

We did a lot of group work this week: creating the team contract and
code of conduct, working on the proposal, and working on the slides for
the monday meeting. We split off into two groups to draft the proposal
report, half of us doing the literature review and proposal
introduction, and the other half drafting the methods, research
questions, and schedule. Through my literature review, I found out about
the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm and added it to the list to try
out. We all came together to put everything together and review and
elevate each other’s work. There are no major roadblocks preventing us
from proceeding in our project.
