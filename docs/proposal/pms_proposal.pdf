Introduction

We all live somewhere and inhabit physical space. Unless one lives completely removed from
others, amenities are usually present in the built environment, such as schools, places of em-
ployment,and healthcare facilities. These amenities serve to make residents’ lives better, and
their distribution is often the result of careful policy and planning by governing bodies. Like
people, they inhabit physical space, and not everybody is equidistant from them. As Alasia et
al. (2021) outline, “having physical access to basic services and amenities is a key determinant
of social inclusion, their capacity to meet basic needs, and their ability to fully participate in
social and economic development.” Therefore, it is imperative for these governing bodies to
make deliberate, well-informed decisions as to the location of new amenities and services.

    The Proximity Measure Database (PMD) developed by the Data Exploration and Inte-
gration Lab (DEIL) at Statistics Canada serves to provide a granular measure of proximity
to services and amenities to inform planning and policy questions (Alasia et al., 2021). The
PMD contains continuous measures for 10 amenities at a ‘dissemination block’ (DB) level, the
most granular area defined by StatCan (Statistics Canada, 2021). In an urban area, a DB
corresponds to a city block, whereas in rural areas they are areas “bounded by roads or other
natural features” (Alasia et al., 2021). Thus, DBs differ broadly in their proximity to these
amenities.

    The goal of this project is to segment the continuous proximity measures in the StatCan
PMD in order to identify stable cutoffs that distinguish dissemination blocks based on their
proximities to amenities. Supplementary factors beyond the proximity indices may impact the
resulting clusters. Intuitively, we would expect that additional information about the DBs such
as remoteness, rural character, population average income or zoning information help increase
the separation between clusters. Rigolon and N´emeth investigated causes of uneven access to
urban amenities in their specific case study of Denver parks. They found that factors such
as funding systems, public policies like zoning, and social mechanisms could significantly alter
access (Rigolon & N´emeth, 2021). While we would expect the aforementioned variables such as
zoning to factor into the PMD values, we need to investigate whether there is data available to
add to the PMD in order to facilitate more distinct clustering results.

    There are various clustering algorithms in the literature, such as the k-means algorithm
(MacQueen, 1967) and the fuzzy c-means algorithm (Bezdek et al., 1984). There are also
various validation metrics defined for assessing clustering quality. These metrics can be used to
evaluate the performance of different clustering algorithms and to determine which algorithm
is the best fit for a particular dataset. Examples of such metrics include Rand Index (RI),
Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), and the F-measure (Mehta et al., 2020).

    The results of this clustering analysis will provide valuable insights to policymakers and
urban planners regarding how to prioritize efforts to improve accessibility and promote social
and economic sustainability. We hope that this research contributes to a better understanding
of local access to amenities for Canadian citizens.

Data Sources

Our primary dataset of interest is the Proximity Measure Database (PMD) from the DEIL at
Statistics Canada, which includes the continuous numerical proximity scores of every dissemi-
nation block (DB) in Canada for 10 amenities: employment, grocery stores, pharmacies, health
care, child care, primary education, secondary education, public transit, neighborhood parks,
and libraries. These proximity measures were calculated using a gravity model that takes into
account the distance between a reference DB and all other DBs where the service is located
within a specified range, as well as the size of those services. Additionally, the presence of
services within the reference DB is factored into the measure. These measures are considered
a reliable way to assess local access to various amenities (OECD 2018). In the PMD, the prox-
imity measures have been normalized across Canada. In this case, a lower proximity measure
indicates that the amenity is located ‘farther away’ from the dissemination block. So, if the
proximity measure is low, it means that the amenity is more distant from the dissemination
block than if the proximity measure were high. The data dictionary for this dataset can be
found here.

    Our secondary dataset is the Index of Remoteness (IoR), also from Statistics Canada. This
dataset includes a continuous numeric remoteness score for each census subdivision (CSD) in
Canada. Index of Remoteness equal to zero for the least remote CSD and equal to one or the
most remote CSD. A census subdivision is a general term used by Statistics Canada to refer to
a municipal or equivalent area. It can be a city, town, village, township, regional municipality,
or other type of local government unit. DBs are smaller geographic units used by Statistics
Canada which fall within CSDs. The IoR can be linked to the proximity measures dataset by
a unique ID that is available in both dataset.

    In terms of missing values, Statistics Canada uses the following standard representations
(Alasia et al., 2021):

                  Symbol  Meaning
                  .       not available for any reference period
                  ..      not available for a specific reference period
                  ...     not applicable
                  F       too unreliable to be published

    We will recode any instance of these symbols with ’NA’. These ’NA’ values are most likely
due to unavailable or missing data in the original datasets used to create the proximity measures,
such as the Business Register, the Linkable Open Data Environment, the Open Database of
Educational Facilities, and the General Transit Feed Specification.

Research Questions

Throughout the project, we will be trying various clustering algorithms. The clusters returned
by these algorithms will be of varying quality; some will be well-defined, and others may be more
muddled. In order to choose one best algorithm, the clusters returned from each algorithm will
have to be compared using a validation metric such as the Dunn Index or Silhouette Coefficient.
These metrics are generalizable between algorithms because they compare intra- and inter-group
variance. Once a “best” clustering algorithm has been chosen, the following two questions can
be asked:

   1. What are the optimal cut-off values and cluster boundaries determined by the chosen
       clustering algorithm in the PMD continuous metric?
3 - MDS Capstone  2023

   2. What distinctive characteristics define each cluster of dissemination blocks, and how do
       these features contribute to both heterogeneity between clusters and homogeneity within
       each cluster? (Characteristics include: proximity measures, CSD type, DB population,
       IoR, and province breakdown.)

Methodology

Our methodology consists of three sequential parts: exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical
analysis, and visualizations.

    The EDA includes:

    • Investigating additional data sources and how to link them.

    • Investigating missing values and ways to deal with them, including imputation and re-
       moval.

    • Investigating characteristics and distributions of variables in the PMD.

    We will test various techniques on the individual proximity measures, all proximity measures
combined, and if possible, proximity measures in conjunction with population density, IoR, CSD
type, and other relevant variables we are able to link. Possible clustering algorithms we may
explore include:

    • Connectivity based (Hierarchical)

          – Complete linkage (Base R)
          – Average linkage (Base R)
          – Single linkage (Base R)
          – BIRCH (stream package)

    • Centroid based

          – k -means (Base R)
          – fuzzy c-means (ppclust package)
          – Mean-shift (meanShiftR package)
          – Affinity propagation (apcluster package)
          – k -means with built-in missing data imputation (ClustImpute package)

    • Distribution based (mixture models)

          – Gaussian Mixture Modelling (mclust package)
          – Model-Based Clustering with the Multivariate t-Distribution (teigen package)
          – Model-Based Clustering with variable selection and estimation of the number of

              clusters (VarSelLCM package)
          – Clustering Mixed data with Missing Values (MixAll package)

    • Density based

          – Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (dbscan package)
          – HDBSCAN (dbscan package)
          – OPTICS = Ordering points to identify the clustering structure (dbscan package)
4 - MDS Capstone  2023

    • Grid based

          – CLIQUE (subspace package)

    Note: Among these algorithms, some are capable of handling missing values (NAs) directly
without imputation, some have built-in imputation methods, and others require that the missing
values be addressed (either imputed or removed) prior to running the algorithm.

    We will explore ways to visualize the results of this work, such as Silhouette plots for
clustering validation and interactive maps similar to Statistics Canada’s Proximity Measures
Data Viewer for the final results. We will select and apply different methods based on how we
handle missing values (NAs) in our data, such as imputing or removing them.

    We will use different approaches to determine the cutoff values or thresholds proximity
indices. So, by comparing the cutoff values suggested by each approach, we can assess the
sensitivity of the results to the choice of method and determine whether the findings are sensitive
(robust) to changes in the method used.

Deliverables

    • Final report showing documentation for all steps of our work: an exploration of the
       data, the different approaches attempted, their validity, a sensitivity analysis, a chosen
       reproducible clustering methodology, the characteristics of the clusters, the identification
       of the PMD cut-off values, and the interpretation of the final results.

    In order to ensure that every team member gains a well-rounded experience and contributes
effectively to the capstone project, we will divide our team into subgroups of two, each focus-
ing on different aspects of the project (on modelling weeks, algorithms will be divided equally
between the two subgroups). We will rotate the members among these subgroups, allowing
everyone the opportunity to work on various components and gain exposure to different chal-
lenges and skill sets. To optimize efficiency, we will hold daily team meetings where we will
assess progress and distribute/prioritize tasks as needed. This collaborative approach will foster
a deeper understanding of the project as a whole, while promoting teamwork.

Limitations

Since the proximity measures dataset was only recently released as “experimental statistics”,
it is possible that better, more comprehensive ways of calculating the proximity index using
more/different data sources may be developed in the future, which may render our methodology
obsolete.

Conclusion

Our project aims to apply clustering algorithms to segment proximity measures for various
amenities as provided by Statistics Canada. The insights gained from this segmentation may
help policymakers and urban planners make informed decisions on how to prioritize efforts to
improve access and promote social and economic sustainability. By selecting a robust clustering
methodology and exploring the relationships between clusters and socio-economic factors, we
hope to contribute to a better understanding of local access to amenities and its implications
on communities.
