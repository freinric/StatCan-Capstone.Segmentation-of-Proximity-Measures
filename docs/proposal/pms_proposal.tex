\section*{Introduction}

text 






\section*{Data Sources}

Our primary dataset of interest is the \href{https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/17-26-0002/2020001/csv/pmd-eng.zip}{Proximity Measures Dataset} (PMD) from the DEIL at Statistics Canada, which includes the continuous numerical proximity scores of every dissemination block (DB) in Canada for 10 services/amenities: employment, grocery stores, pharmacies, health care, child care, primary education, secondary education, public transit, neighborhood parks, and libraries. These proximity measures were calculated using a gravity model that takes into account the distance between a reference DB and all other DBs where the service is located within a specified range, as well as the size of those services. Additionally, the presence of services within the reference DB is factored into the measure. These measures are considered a reliable way to assess local access to various amenities. The data dictionary for this dataset can be found \href{https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/71-607-x/71-607-x2020011-eng.htm}{here}. 
\par
Our secondary dataset is the \href{https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/17-26-0001/172600012020001-eng.htm}{Index of Remoteness}, also from Statistics Canada. This dataset includes a continuous numeric remoteness score for each census subdivision in Canada. It will need to be linked to the proximity measures dataset by determining which DBs reside in each census subdivision. 






\section*{Research Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Which clustering approach is best at identifying meaningful cutoff values/segments in the proximity measures? 
\item Is our chosen clustering approach robust? 
\item What are the characteristics of each cluster of DBs? 
\item Can a generalized clustering approach be applied to all amenity types, or should specific clustering methods be used for different amenities? 
\item Are there correlations between the identified clusters and socio-economic factors, such as population density, building density, or the proportion of rural/urban areas? 
\item Can additional datasets provide further insights into amenity accessibility or more clear clusters? 
\end{enumerate}






\section*{Methodology}

\comment{
\subsection*{Data Investigation}
\subsection*{Statistical Analysis}
\subsection*{Visualization}
}

Our methodology consists of three sequential parts: exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, and visualizations.
\par
The EDA includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Data can be downloaded, already cleaned and prepped from the Statistics Canada Website. 
\item Investigating missing values and ways to deal with them. 
\item Base Model – Intuition/Violin Plots (individual measures only).
\end{itemize}

We will perform various techniques on different subsets of the datasets, such as individual proximity measures, all proximity measures combined, and proximity measures in conjunction with population density, Index of Remoteness, and neighborhood income. Possible clustering algorithms we may explore include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Connectivity based (Hierarchical) 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Complete linkage (Base R)
	\item Average linkage (Base R)
	\item Single linkage (Base R)
	\item BIRCH (\texttt{stream} package)
\end{itemize}
\item Centroid based
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{k}-means (Base R)
	\item fuzzy c-means (\texttt{ppclust} package)
   	\item Mean-shift (\texttt{meanShiftR} package)
   	\item Affinity propagation (\texttt{apcluster} package)
\end{itemize}
\item Distribution based (mixture models)
\begin{itemize}
	\item Gaussian Mixture Modelling (\texttt{mclust} package)
   	\item Model-Based Clustering with the Multivariate t-Distribution (\texttt{teigen} package)
\end{itemize}
\item Density based
\begin{itemize}
	\item Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (\texttt{dbscan} package)
	\item HDBSCAN (\texttt{dbscan} package) 
	\item OPTICS = Ordering points to identify the clustering structure (\texttt{dbscan} package) 
\end{itemize}
\item Grid based
\begin{itemize}
	\item CLIQUE (\texttt{subspace} package)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

All clustering approaches will be compared and validated to assess clustering quality. We will explore different metrics defined in the literature, such as the Dunn Index and Silhouette Coefficient. 
\par 
We will explore ways to visualize the results of this work, such as Silhouette plots for clustering validation and interactive maps similar to Statistics Canada’s Proximity Measures \href{https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/71-607-x/71-607-x2020011-eng.htm}{Data Viewer} for the final results. 




\section*{Deliverables}

\begin{itemize}
\item A document describing our chosen reproducible clustering methodology.
\item Final report showing the different approaches attempted, their validity, and a sensitivity analysis. 
\item Mapbox interactive choropleth map visualization. 
\item Final presentation slides. 
\end{itemize}

In order to ensure that every team member gains a well-rounded experience and contributes effectively to the capstone project, we will divide our team into smaller groups (groups of 2), each focusing on different aspects of the project. Over the course of the project, we will rotate the members among these groups, allowing everyone the opportunity to work on various components and gain exposure to different challenges and skill sets. To optimize efficiency, we will hold daily team meetings where we will assess progress and distribute/prioritize tasks as needed. This collaborative approach will foster a deeper understanding of the project as a whole, while promoting teamwork across the entire team. 




\section*{Limitations}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The proximity measures dataset has lots of missing data. Once data is available for many smaller/uninhabited/remote DBs, it may skew our clustering results and our algorithm may need to be replaced. 
\item Since the proximity measures dataset was only recently released as ``experimental statistics", it is possible that better, more comprehensive ways of calculating the proximity index using more/different data sources may be developed in the future, which may render our methodology obsolete. 
\end{enumerate}





\section*{Conclusion}


Our project aims to apply clustering algorithms to segment proximity measures for various amenities as provided by Statistics Canada. The insights gained from this segmentation can help policymakers and urban planners make informed decisions on how to prioritize efforts to improve access and promote social and economic sustainability. By selecting a robust clustering methodology and exploring the relationships between clusters and socio-economic factors, we hope to contribute to a better understanding of local access to amenities and its implications on communities.
